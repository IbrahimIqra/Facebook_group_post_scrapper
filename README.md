# Facebook_group_post_scrapper
A script to scrap posts from facebook group and send the updates via emails given the proper login info.

1) This script is only sending information from YOUR
   EMAIL after accessing YOUR FB ACCOUNT, the info of
   which you yourself will give as input. The info
   ISN'T being sent ANYWHERE ELSE. Feel free to check
   the source code to verify, which will be bundled
   with this.

2) Download everything and keep them in the same folder.
3) Run the 'fb_grp_scrapper.exe'.
4) Input the required fields. MAKE SURE THEY'RE CORRECT.

**[Must enable "less secured app access" in the sender's gmail account]**

5) Keep Running the Script in the background.
6) If PC Restarted or Turned off, run it again after
   booting up the PC.

======================IMPORTANT======================

7) If you want to run the script for the same group
   again, then no need to change anything just run 
   the exe file.
8) If you want to reuse the script for a different
   group after running it once, then you have to 
   delete everything in the 'fb_grp_post_ids.txt'.
   Then run the exe file again.
